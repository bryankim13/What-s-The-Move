# What-s-The-Move
Database semester long project with a group of 5 students including myself. Our group had created a date suggestion website for those in the Charlottesville area who are in need of finding somewhere to go for a date. We used mysql with phpmyadmin as our database, connecting our app with PHP. 

Features: 
  Security: Utilized hashing passwords and storing them on separate tables in order to prevent easy leaks.
            Also implemented prepared statements to prevent sql injections
  Ajax: Used Ajax to search the locations without reloading the pages
  Used stored procedures and triggers as advanced sql functions
